		 * Strings are collections of characters that allow programmers to
		 * stores words and sentences
		 * 
		 * When we talk about Strings we want to talk about
		 * 
		 * 1. Length:	How many characters are in the string.
		 * 2. Indexes:	This is how we access parts of the string. 
		 * 				Indexes go from 0 to lenght - 1
		 * 
		 *  Example:
		 *  
		 *  String = "Monkey"
		 *  
		 *  Monkey has a length of 6 and indexes 0 to 5
		 *  
		 *  012345
		 *  Monkey
